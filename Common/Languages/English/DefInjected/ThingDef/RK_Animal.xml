  <RK_KingHamster.description>A giant hamster. Unlike Ratkin, they never evolved into a higher being and were instead domesticated, becoming the primary farm animal of Ratkin society because of their cuteness and their large bodies. They are incredibly unintelligent, but they can be tamed and used as pack animals. They can easily tolerate hotter temperatures.</RK_KingHamster.description>
